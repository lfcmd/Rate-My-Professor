        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to RateMyProfessor.space's Privacy Policy. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to
          protecting your personal information. This policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our
          AI-powered professor review generator.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Our service is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not require registration and we do not
          store personal data associated with your reviews. The information we process is limited to what is
          necessary to generate the review. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Review Parameters:</strong> The ratings, keywords, and writing style you select to generate a
            review.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Generated Content:</strong> The professor review text created by the AI.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This information is processed ephemerally and is not stored or linked to any personal identifiers.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information you provide solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To generate a personalized professor review based on your inputs.</li>
          <li>To improve our AI models and the quality of our service. All data used for improvement is anonymized.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          We do not store the reviews you generate or the parameters you input. The entire process is stateless.
          Your information is sent to our AI provider for generation and is not retained on our servers.
        </p>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          We use third-party AI models to power our review generation. These providers have their own privacy policies,
          and we have chosen partners who are committed to data privacy and security. We do not share any personally
          identifiable information with them because we do not collect it in the first place.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Since we do not store any personal information, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete.
          Your use of the service is anonymous.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
          Privacy Policy on this page.
        </p>
